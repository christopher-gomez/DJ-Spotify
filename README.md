# DJ-Spotify
Machine Learning with Spotify and Alexa

This is just a repository for my Jupyter notebook. Jupyter notebooks are great for combining graphs, data, and code in one file but really great for applying to actual final products. The Alexa code is actually an Express server, hosted on Heroku, that calls upon the final python script that was made from code snippets from this notebook. To see the notebook just click on that DJ Spotify.ipynb file
